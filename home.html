        <p> The 48 Laws of Power is a self-help book. It teaches you about power that is used by influential figures throughout history. Some say this book is manipulative, although if you use this book to manipulate, the game will somehow turn against you. This book teaches the underlying principles of power, and it can also teach us how they can be applied and avoided in various situations. These laws will influence any reader interested in gaining, observing and defending against ultimate power. Anyways, here are some of my favorite books that I read!</p>
